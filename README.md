# SMS-Email-Spam-Classification
A machine learning-based spam detection system that classifies SMS or email messages as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). It preprocesses the text, converts it into numerical vectors, and applies a trained model for classification. The system is deployed using Streamlit, enabling users to enter messages and receive instant predictions.
Key Skills:
Python programming
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
Machine learning model training and evaluation
Pickle for model persistence (model.pkl, vectorizer.pkl)
Streamlit for interactive web app deployment
